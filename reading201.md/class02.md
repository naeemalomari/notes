## Basics of HTML, CSS & JS:
## HTML code have some constant things that if you didn't do it this is going to make errors so you have to follow the instructions to have a clean html code, the first frequent mistakes openning tags with a closing one every open tag should have a close tag, be attintion while you're writing an images, links because it have a specific way to write, you can also write heading as you want but as we described any open heading tag will have a close heading tag here is an example for how we can writie a heading <h1>"type something"</h1>, we can also write a paragraphes <p>"your paragraphe</p> or you can use any letter, adding a video or audio or any image in our html web page have some inctructions also for an audio ( <audio src="audio link">) here will show the audio, the same for the video but calling < video scr"video link">
## CSS will make your page more attractive by using the background color's, fonts color, changing the display of images, changing the way while writing a links and many other orders,but first of all you have to link your HTML page with your CSS in a different ways **Internal** in  the head tags you can write <style>" CSS rules " </style> the second way **Inline** the CSS style here will be in the open tag,**External** in this way you have to make a style CSS sheet and link it with HTML page : < link rel= "stylesheet" href="name of your CSS page">.
## Javascript: before start coding you have to link your html with the script by following this step < script> scr="javacript file name " > </script> make sure you are putting this link in the footer tag it's not necessary but this is the best practice because it will run in the footer tags also ,and do it correctly, we should also know how to write objects and method an example document.write('hello good morning ') where document is the object, . is the member operator, write('hello good morning ') is the method and 'hello good morning' is the parameter.
## statement is a very imrprtant part in javascript it will enhance your code to achive your goal,before statement you have to make sure that you have all the variables (it's something to store values inside or can hold values) in the statement ,also it's include a condition that should be true to git in the statement (ARITHMETIC OPERATORS), we have three data type **1- String** any text between double and single quotes is a string , **2- Number ** any number in mathmatices , **3-boolean** true or false, using /* multiline comment */ and // single line comment.
