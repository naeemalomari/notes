**Expressions and operators-:**
## A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true.
## Any comparison will be comparing the type and the value and that's the different between 8 and '8' they will be the same value but different type it will be also applied for the comparing numbers great or grater than or less or less than or equals, again it should be the same as a type and number.
## An arithmetic operator takes numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and returns a single numerical value.
## in another languages these operators used to work like floating and pointer not only for a mathmatical reasons.
## Logical operators are typically used with Boolean (logical) values; when they are, they return a Boolean value ( True or False ).
## each type of logical operator have a single operand to used, examples of expressions that can be converted to false are those that evaluate to null, 0, NaN, the empty string (""), or undefined.
**Loops and iteration:- **
## A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. 
## for example : while ( condition) {
  ## we can write our code here.
}
## we use while loop  when we don't know how many times we are going to loop. 
## A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.
## for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression]) { here is the condition }.
