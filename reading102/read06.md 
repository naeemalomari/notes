## JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task and is executed when something invokes it. 
## Function ( Parameter, Parameter ) {
  Code 
  return (this is important to make sure that you will not have a undefined )
} 
## parameter (argument), function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked. 
## we have two types to write a function : 
**Function declarations** 
**Function expressions**
## If we want to reuse any function we just recall it by the name of the function and it will be working again and again.
