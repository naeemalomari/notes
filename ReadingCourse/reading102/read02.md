##  I will describe what I have learned today about GIT and GitHub for you my friends, regardless of your back ground if it is technical or not. GIT is a version control, and what does that mean?

##  It is like history tracking system in very powerful manner, imagine that you want to track changes you are making to a text file for two weeks, so GIT is the best way to track the history and review and compare different versions.

## Now imagine that for code snippets and source code files, in the end regardless of their extensions they contain text. Real application for GIT is a team can share track and manage changes between each other’s for single project as follows:

•    Cloning the same project from one remote repository(location).

•    Sharing changes with team members by committing and pushing code changes to the remote repo.

•    Getting other team members changes buy pulling changes periodically from remote repo. Finally, GitHub is just a vendor for GIT (very popular vendor) that provide git services remotely with many features.
