## Java basics : 

## The variables in Java takes fields, you have to define the numbers as int, there is four types of Variables **Instance Variables (Non-Static Fields)** , **Class Variables (Static Fields)** , **Local Variables**, **Parameters**.

## About the naming you can choose any name except keyword or reserved word specially when you are writing a single word because these reserved words are built in words in Java so try to avoid writing the same names, you can include "_" in the name or you can capitalize the first letter in the second name to avoid errors, DON'T let the names included with a white spaces.

## Expressions, Statements, and Blocks is very important to read when you are using any new language you have to know how to write the syntaxes and how it's going to work how to treat it in the code. 


## XKCD: Compiling:

## what is compile code : It's more like converting the programming languages from (Java, C#) to zero's and one's ( machine language ) because it's the machine language to make it readable to the computer and run it, it takes a very short time. it will be converted as it is that's why we have to put the colons sometimes and semicolons at the end of every line.

## It will be like what you inserted exactly, if it's working doesn't mean it's working. because it will sort sometimes in nonlogical way.

## Reading Java Documentation:

## Java has everything you need to end up with a standard application programming interface it include's more than 4000 classes with it's own functionality, limitations and own rules, were you can search about them easily using this URL **docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/**, while choosing your appropriate index you have to notice that there is differ from choosing println as int, long, and some other types, and sometimes you will be confused because some of them has the same meaning, so be aware when you are going to choose, if you want to open one link you will have an explanation for this index.

## In the same above link you can also search about classes,
