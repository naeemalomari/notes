**Mongo and Mongoose**

**SQL**

- use tables to store data
- SQL databases have predefined schema
- SQL databases are vertically scalable
- SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware
- SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data
- SQL database examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL

**NoSQL**

- Use documents
- NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data
- The NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable
- NoSQL databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load
- In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database.
- NoSQL database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

If your data is highly structured and associations among the program entities are clearly defined

## Give a real world example?

(for instance, if you are developing a point of sale system where you need to store customer orders and product records), conventional SQL based databases are the best fit.

## What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

NoSQL seems to work better on both unstructured and unrelated data. The better solutions are the crossover databases that have elements of both NoSQL and SQL.

## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

Document based database like MongoDB, and Redis are great for small scale, hierarchical data with a relatively small amount of children for each entry.


## Which type of database is best for scalability?

MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, all are highly scalable, itâ€™s just that they require little maintenance for it. All SQL based databases are very stable, and are in production since years.
