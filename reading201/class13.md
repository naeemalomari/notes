## Local Storage :

## In the past it was only internet explorer to use, and microsoft did many things to develop it.It was called DHTML behaviors one of these behaviors was **UserData** which it's enough to use 640 KD for anybody.

## what is HTML5 storage :

## it's a way for web pages to store named value pairs locally, with in the client web browser, but from our javascript code we will access HTML5 storage through the local storage object on the global window object, by using function support-html5-storage() and try to take access, calling set item with a named key that already exists will silently overwrite the previous value. But calling it with non-existent key will return than throw an exception.
