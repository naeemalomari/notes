## Introductory HTML and JavaScript:
## HTML, CSS is used in many web pages, it's simple to learn from books or YouTube or you can can use google to teach you how to write the structure of HTML. which includes the semantic and nonsemantic tags that we will discuss through the book.
## CSS gives the background color, fonts type, colors HTML with CSS makes the web page looks better , as we know HTML for the structure and CSS for good presentation. 
## HTML structure have specifi procedure to write, all html pages should include semantic and nonsemantic tags as we mentioed above semantics means tha tags that you know as a web developer what you have to write in it and all the developers know's too ( header, main, footer,article and so on ), but nonsemantic tags you can say that it's the tags that you are not going to write a spesific elements (div,section and so on )
## ( <p> ) this called an open tag with includes a left-angle bracket , P is the  Character and right-angle bracket, closing tag will be the same with a very simple different you sould add ( </p> ), includes a forward slash, we can add comment ( <!-- --> ) ,we can add images, links, also many atttibute and elemnts.
## CSS have also good styling as we described above, but the important thing is linking between HTML and CSS : there is a three ways to link them together 1- internal you can call many elemet tags in one css order line < style > CSS ruels </style> 2-inline this way you have to write it inside the open tag 3- external and the last way is to write them in the css style sheet by using the linking below link rel= stylesheet href= "the name of your css page ">.
## I would like to recommend before starting any line in html or css try to write a wire frame that you will start imagine how the html and css will look like, how you will start writing your code with it , you will know where should you put the body , the main and what you have to write in it so it's very important to know where you are writing in wich tag I mean.
## Javascript is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal, and here is the most important point ( achieve a goal ) before you start writing a script you have to know what you are going to do what your code need to include, what is your task.
## java script also should be linked like CSS in html and this step is important to make the web site running because adding the link in a wrong place will make many problems so the best practice that you add the link after the footing and it will be linkeed as ( <script " your javascript name page "> </script> ).
