## What is a component ?

Component is a software object intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality. It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture.

## What are the characteristics of a component ?

**Reusability** components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications and some of them are designed for a specific task.

**Replaceable** Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.

**Not Context Specific** Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts. 

**Extensible** A Component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

**Encapsulated** A Component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use it's functionality,and not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

**independent** Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.


## what are the advantages of using component based architecture ?

**Ease of deployment** As new compatible versions become available, it is easier to replace existing versions with no impact on the other components ot the system as a whole.

**Reduced Cost** The use of third-party components allows you to spread the cost of development and maintenance.

**Ease Of Development** components implement well-known interfaces to provide defined functionality, allowing development without impacting other parts of the system 

**Reuseable** the use of reusable components means that they can be used to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications or systems.

**Modifications Of Technical Complexity** A Component modifies the complexity through the use of a component container and its services.

**Reliability** The overall system reliability increases since the reliability of each individual component enhances the reliability of the whole system  via reuse.

**System Maintenance And Evolution** Easy to change and update the implementation without affecting the rest of the system.

**Independent** Independency and flexible connectivity of components.
