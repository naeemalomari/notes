**6 Reasons for Pair Programming** 

## What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness

I think greater efficiency because you will just have to understand each other and then work together share your idea's and how we can do this and this like it's going to be faster and easier for both.

## How does pair programming work?

Pair programming needs at least two persons to work as well, you will have a Driver and the Navigator, the Driver who writes the code and check the result by his hand but the Navigator will just tells the driver what he/ she exactly what to do, but sometimes it could be hard to tell someone where do you want to write something so maybe you have to do pair programming in good applications like zoom to handle this issue.
