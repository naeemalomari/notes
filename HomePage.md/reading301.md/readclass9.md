programming paradigm a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs.

## What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

It returns the same result if given the same arguments.

## What are the benefits of a pure function?

The code’s definitely easier to test. We don’t need to mock anything. So we can unit test pure functions with different contexts:

## What is immutability?

Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.

## What is Referential transparency?

is the adding between pure functions and immutable data .
