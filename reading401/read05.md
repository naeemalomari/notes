## Big O: Analysis of Algorithm Efficiency

## Big O(oh) notation is used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm or function. This efficiency is evaluated based on 2 factors

## Running Time (also known as time efficiency / complexity) The amount of time a function needs to complete

## Memory Space (also known as space efficiency / complexity) The amount of memory resources a function uses to store data and instructions

## (Links to an external site.)Worst Case, Best Case, Average Case

## Even though Big O describes the Worst Case for algorithm efficiency, we can still think about Best and Average cases. Each of these cases could be analyzed as we consider the overall question: As inputs n fluctuate in size and order, how does this affect our orders of Growth?

## Worst Case: The efficiency for the worst possible input of size n This case runs the longest for all possible inputs of n. This assumes that if we were sorting values, inputs are completely unsorted and searched values either don’t exist or are at the last to be searched

## Best Case: The efficiency for the best possible input of size n This case runs the quickest for all possible inputs of n. In the case of sorting, this assumes that values are sorted, and so searched-for values are easy to find

## Average Case: The efficiency for a “typical” or “random” input of size n. The average case makes a typical assumption about the possible inputs of size ‘n’ and how they might affect efficiency. This is NOT the best case and worst case averaged together

## Big O: The worst case analysis of algorithm efficiency

## Running Time: The amount of time required for an algorithm to complete

## Memory Space: The amount of memory resources required for an algorithm to complete

## Input Size: Represented by the variable n, the total size of values used as parameters in an algorithm

## Big Omega: The best case analysis of algorithm efficiency

## Big Theta: The typical or random case used for analysis of algorithm efficiency

## (Links to an external site.)What is a Linked List

## A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link

## There are two types of Linked List - Singly and Doubly. We will be implementing a Singly Linked List in this implementation

## (Links to an external site.)Traversal Big O

## The Big O of time for Includes would be O(n). This is because, at its worse case, the node we are looking for will be the very last node in the linked list. n represents the number of nodes in the linked list

## The Big O of space for Includes would be O(1). This is because there is no additional space being used than what is already given to us with the linked list input

## (Links to an external site.)Linear data structures

## One characteristic of linked lists is that they are linear data structures, which means that there is a sequence and an order to how they are constructed and traversed

## The fundamental difference between arrays and linked lists is that arrays are static data structures, while linked lists are dynamic data structures
