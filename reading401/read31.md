# Read: 31 - Espresso

## [Espresso](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso)

- Use Espresso to write concise, beautiful, and reliable Android UI tests.

- Espresso tests run optimally fast! It lets you leave your waits, syncs, sleeps, and polls behind while it manipulates and asserts on the application UI when it is at rest.

### Target audience

- Espresso is targeted at developers.
- While it can be used for black-box testing, Espresso’s full power is unlocked by those who are familiar with the codebase under test.

### Synchronization capabilities

- Each time your test invokes onView(), Espresso waits to perform the corresponding UI action or assertion until the following synchronization conditions are met:

- The message queue is empty.
- There are no instances of AsyncTask currently executing a task.
- All developer-defined idling resources are idle.

### Packages

- **espresso-core** - Contains core and basic View matchers, actions, and assertions. See Basics and Recipes.
- **espresso-web** - Contains resources for WebView support.
- **espresso-idling-resource** - Espresso's mechanism for synchronization with background jobs.
- **espresso-contrib** - External contributions that contain DatePicker, RecyclerView and Drawer actions, accessibility checks, and CountingIdlingResource.
- **espresso-intents** - Extension to validate and stub intents for hermetic testing.
- **espresso-remote** - Location of Espresso's multi-process functionality.

## [Ridiculous superpower: the Espresso Test Recorder](https://developer.android.com/studio/test/espresso-test-recorder)

- **The Espresso Test Recorder tool** lets you create **UI tests** for your app without writing any test code.

- The Espresso API encourages you to create concise and reliable UI tests based on user actions.

## Turn off animations on your test device

- Before using Espresso Test Recorder, make sure you turn off animations on your test device to prevent unexpected results.

## Record an Espresso test

- **Espresso tests consist of two primary components:**
 UI interactions and assertions on View elements.
- Assertions verify the existence or contents of visual elements on the screen.`For example, an Espresso test for the Notes testing app might include UI interactions for clicking on a button and writing a new note but would use assertions to verify the existence of the button and the contents of the note.`

### Record UI interactions

- **To start recording a test with Espresso Test Recorder, proceed as follows:**

1. Click Run > Record Espresso Test.
2. In the Select Deployment Target window, choose the device on which you want to record the test. If necessary, create a new Android Virtual Device. Click OK.
3. Espresso Test Recorder triggers a build of your project, and the app must install and launch before Espresso Test Recorder allows you to interact with it. The Record Your Test window appears after the app launches, and since you have not interacted with the device yet, the main panel reads "No events recorded yet." Interact with your device to start logging events such as "tap" and "type" actions.

### Add assertions to verify UI elements

- **Assertions verify the existence or contents of a View element through three main types:**

1. text is: Checks the text content of the selected View element
2. exists: Checks that the View element is present in the current View hierarchy visible on the screen
3. does not exist: Checks that the View element is not present in the current View hierarchy
