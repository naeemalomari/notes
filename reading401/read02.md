## Java Imports :

## Packages included the directory and it contains all the java files with the classes so when ever you want to use a specific class you have to import the package. 

## there is three options to import a class so let's say we are going to use the JOptionPane class :

## import javax.swing* ( if you have the (*) sign that means all the classes in this package are available to use and this is the most common used). 

## import javax.swing.JOptionPane (makes a single class visible).

## The last option is to use it in the code for example **javax.swing.JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Hi" ).

## Different types of loops in Java:

## Java provides different types of loops like :

**For Loop** **for-each Loop** **While Loop** **Do-While loop**.
