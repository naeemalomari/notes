**Java OO Tutorial :**

## Objects

## Objects are the key to understand the object-oriented technology, which every object have a state and behavior , for example your car is an object which have a state which is the current gear , current speed and have a behavior let's say like changing this gear or changing the speed

## Objects have benefits like

## Modularity: The source code for an object can be written and maintained independently of the source code for other objects. Once created, an object can be easily passed around inside the system

## Information-hiding: By interacting only with an object's methods, the details of its internal implementation remain hidden from the outside world

## Code re-use: If an object already exists (perhaps written by another software developer), you can use that object in your program. This allows specialists to implement/test/debug complex, task-specific objects, which you can then trust to run in your own code

## Plug ability and debugging ease: If a particular object turns out to be problematic, you can simply remove it from your application and plug in a different object as its replacement. This is analogous to fixing mechanical problems in the real world. If a bolt breaks, you replace it, not the entire machine


## Class :

## You may have many similar objects but maybe they will have different classes. 

**Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers :**

## numbers in java could be cutting into parts for example if you have **17.591** first of all you will separate it for the left side and the right side, the left side is  considered as ones and tens number 7 is the ones and number 1 is the tens every position further to the left is 10 times bigger, for the right side 5 is the tenths , 9 is the hundredths and 1 is thousandths.
