## Java OO Tutorial. 

**Inheritance** : 

## Different Kinds of object have a certain amount in common with each other. lets say that you have a copy for an object but there is something you would like to change in the state and behavior. So the new object is inherit the state and behavior's with some editing .

## Also we have the subclasses which you can create it using key word "extends" .

**Interface** : 

## interface methods create an event lets say between you and the code for example the television have the buttons that it's the interface between you and the electrical wiring.

## When we want to use the interface we have to use the keyword **implements**.

**Package** : 

## The java Platform API specification contains the complete listing for all packages, interfaces, classes, fields and methods supplied by the Java SE platform. it's more like a folder which contain the classes and the interfaces.
